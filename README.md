# Tools-graphviz

[Apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) package that contains the [Graphvix](https://graphviz.org/) releases. Only for Windows.

NOTES:
* This package is available for windows only. For linux and darwin, the upstream ``oss-cad-suite`` package already contains the graphviz tools.
* The upstream packages are available at https://graphviz.org/download/
* We follow the versioning number of the graphviz upstream package.
* (Open point) Should we try to match the graphviz version here to the one available in the upstream oss-cad-tools package we use? (Graphviz 2.43.x as of Nov 2024.)

### Versions

* 12.1.2
